Resolutions - A Goal's List

Resolutions is a small development project I made for myself a bit after the New Year's. 

It works basically like a task-app, but instead of crossing off chores, you write down things you want to do with descriptions/goals/resources and leave them there. 

You can edit the information inside of them or remove the card once you've achieved your goal/if you changed your mind. 

I did this as a way to keep track of my own "New Year's Resolutions" in a nice looking little website.
